#This chunk of code should take the arrays, A, b, c that garys code outputs, or will output
# and turn it into one large augmented matrix.
# I've tested it on a couple different matrices for A, b, c but feel free to try more and let me know 
# if anything is wrong. I assumed that A,b,c are arrays. Which is good, since I want to augment a 0
# at the end b. Either way, if gary outputs matrices, I can change my code pretty easily. 


import numpy as np

A =Matrix([[1,1,1,1],[2,2,2,2],[3,3,3,3],[4,4,4,4]])   # These are the example matrices 
b = [1,2,3,4]
c = Matrix([[1,2,3,4]])

Matrix(A) 
Matrix(c)

I = Matrix(np.eye(len(list(A))))   #creates the identity matrix based on the size of A

czero = Matrix(np.zeros(shape=(1,len(list(c[0])))))  #creates/adds the additional zeros for the c row
c = c.augment(czero)

b.append(0)     #creates/adds/transposes the b matrix in prep for augmenting
b = Matrix(b).T

body = A.augment(I)   #augments the identity with A
body = body.stack(c)   #augments A|I with c along the bottom
final = body.augment(b)  #augments the body with b transposed.
