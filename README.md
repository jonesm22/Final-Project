Final-Project
=============

Our group inlclueds, Andrea Gagliano, Brian Purvance, Melissa Jones, and Gary Morales. We wrote code that will be 
to the existing cvxopt in sage currently but it will be more user friendly and have a tutorial option. Our program
uses the simplex method for either the primal linear optimization problem or its dual. It outputs a graph (2D only) 
and the pivots along with the feasible solutions/value and final optimal solutions/value.
