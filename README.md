Final-Project
=============

My partner for the final project is Brian Purvance. We plan on writing code to solve for linear optimization problems.
Our code will output a graph of the polyherdron of the problem along with the highlighted maximum or minimum to the
problem. In addition we will output the final matrix of the problem along with the max/min value and the variables that
arrive at the max/min value. Finally we will tell the user of our code, the method of solution (simplex via primal
or dual or if the problem is infeasible). Our code will address the problems that occur in linear programs such as
infeasibility and the need for a dual or augmentation. Our code will use the simplex method to solve either the primal
or dual problem to the linear optimization.
